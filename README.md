# ETL Weather Insights Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements an **End-to-End ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline** to retrieve, process, and store weather data from a public API into a PostgreSQL database. Using cutting-edge tools like **Apache Airflow**, **Docker**, and **Astronomer**, the pipeline delivers data-driven decision-making for weather analysis and forecasting.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Pipeline**: Seamlessly extracts weather data from an API, processes it, and stores it in a structured format.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides clean, reliable weather data for downstream analysis, enabling applications in forecasting, agriculture, and climate monitoring.
- **Highly Scalable**: Modular architecture to handle large datasets and integrate additional data sources.
- **Robust Orchestration**: Apache Airflow schedules, monitors, and manages all pipeline tasks efficiently.
- **Containerized Environment**: Leveraging Docker and Astronomer ensures portability and consistency across different environments.

## Architecture

The project uses a modern ETL pipeline architecture:
1. **Extract**:
   - Weather data is retrieved from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2. **Transform**:
   - Raw data undergoes validation, cleansing, and restructuring using Python scripts.
3. **Load**:
   - The transformed data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database for storage and querying.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Apache Airflow**: Task orchestration and scheduling.
- **Python**: Data extraction, transformation, and script-based processing.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for efficient data storage and querying.
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment ensuring portability and ease of use.
- **Astronomer**: Airflow-as-a-Service platform for seamless pipeline management.
- **API Integration**: Utilized REST APIs for real-time weather data.
